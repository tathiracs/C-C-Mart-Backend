   - Note down:
     - `MYSQLHOST` (e.g., containers-us-west-123.railway.app)
     - `MYSQLPORT` (usually 3306)
     - `MYSQLDATABASE` (your database name)
     - `MYSQLUSER` (usually root)

## ðŸ”§ SQL to Run

Copy and paste this into your Railway MySQL query interface:

```sql
-- ============================================================
-- Add Order Items to Orders #7, #8, #9
-- ============================================================

-- First, check if orders exist
SELECT id, order_number, total_amount FROM orders WHERE id IN (7, 8, 9);

-- Order #7 - Basidh Nizam (LKR 1,620.00)
-- Items: Tomatoes, Milk, Bread, Water
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES
(7, 1, 2, 120.00),   -- 2kg Fresh Tomatoes @ 120
(7, 6, 3, 280.00),   -- 3 bottles Fresh Milk @ 280
(7, 13, 2, 150.00),  -- 2 loaves White Bread @ 150
(7, 17, 2, 120.00);  -- 2 bottles Mineral Water @ 120

-- Order #8 - Geesara adhithya (LKR 350.00 â†’ 330.00)
-- Items: Onions, Water
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES
(8, 5, 1, 150.00),   -- 1kg Onions @ 150
(8, 17, 2, 90.00);   -- 2 bottles Mineral Water @ 90
UPDATE orders SET total_amount = 330.00 WHERE id = 8;

-- Order #9 - Tathira Samarakoon (LKR 2,460.00)
-- Items: Bananas, Eggs, Milk, Bread
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES
(9, 4, 2, 180.00),   -- 2kg Bananas @ 180
(9, 8, 2, 550.00),   -- 2 dozen Farm Eggs @ 550
(9, 6, 3, 280.00),   -- 3 bottles Fresh Milk @ 280
(9, 13, 1, 150.00);  -- 1 loaf White Bread @ 150

-- ============================================================
-- Verification Query - Run this to confirm success
-- ============================================================
SELECT 
    o.id AS order_id,
    o.order_number,
    u.name AS customer_name,
    o.total_amount,
    COUNT(oi.id) AS items_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS calculated_total
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.id IN (7, 8, 9)
GROUP BY o.id, o.order_number, u.name, o.total_amount;

-- Show detailed breakdown of items
SELECT 
    o.id AS order_id,
    o.order_number,
    p.name AS product_name,
    oi.quantity,
    CONCAT('LKR ', oi.price) AS unit_price,
    CONCAT('LKR ', oi.quantity * oi.price) AS subtotal
FROM order_items oi
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.id IN (7, 8, 9)
ORDER BY o.id, oi.id;
```

## âœ… After Running the SQL

1. **Check Railway logs** to ensure no errors occurred
2. **Refresh your admin dashboard** at your hosted frontend URL
3. **Click on "Order Management"**
4. **Expand each order** (click the down arrow)
5. **You should now see the order items!**

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Product with ID X doesn't exist"
**Solution:** The products might have different IDs in your database. Run this to check:
```sql
SELECT id, name, price FROM products LIMIT 20;
```
Then update the `product_id` values in the INSERT statements.

### Problem: "Order with ID X doesn't exist"
**Solution:** Check what order IDs you have:
```sql
SELECT id, order_number, total_amount FROM orders ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;
```
Use the actual order IDs from your database.

### Problem: "Duplicate entry"
**Solution:** Items already exist. First delete them:
```sql
DELETE FROM order_items WHERE order_id IN (7, 8, 9);
```
Then run the INSERT statements again.
