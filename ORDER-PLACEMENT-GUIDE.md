### Check Order Appears in Database

-- View all orders
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View order items
SELECT oi.*, p.name as product_name 
FROM order_items oi 
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id 
WHERE oi.order_id = 123;

-- View orders by user
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 5;
```
