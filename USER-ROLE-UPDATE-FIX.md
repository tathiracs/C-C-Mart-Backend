# User Role Update Fix

## Summary
Added missing backend endpoints to support user management operations including role updates, user deletion, and status changes by admin users.

---

## Problem

The admin user management page was calling API endpoints that didn't exist:
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update user (including role)
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete user

**Error:** API calls were failing because these endpoints were missing from the backend.

---

## Solution

Added two new endpoints to `UserController.java`:

### 1. **Update User Endpoint**
- **Route:** `PUT /api/users/{id}`
- **Access:** Admin only
- **Functionality:** Updates user information including role

### 2. **Delete User Endpoint**  
- **Route:** `DELETE /api/users/{id}`
- **Access:** Admin only
- **Functionality:** Deletes users (with safety checks)

---

## Implementation Details

### File: `backend/src/main/java/com/ccmart/backend/controller/UserController.java`

#### 1. Update User Endpoint

```java
@PutMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<?> updateUser(Authentication authentication, @PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User updatedUser)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin authentication required
- ✅ Updates user profile fields (name, email, phone, address)
- ✅ **Updates user role** (admin/customer)
- ✅ Updates active status
- ✅ Email uniqueness validation
- ✅ Role validation (only 'admin' or 'customer')
- ✅ Password not returned in response

**Updateable Fields:**
| Field | Description | Validation |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `name` | Full name | Non-empty string |
| `email` | Email address | Unique, valid format |
| `phone` | Phone number | Any string |
| `address` | Address | Any string |
| `role` | User role | 'admin' or 'customer' only |
| `isActive` | Account status | Boolean |

**Security Checks:**
1. User must be authenticated
2. Authenticated user must be admin
3. Email must be unique (if changing)
4. Role must be valid

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "0771234567",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "role": "customer",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-19T...",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-19T..."
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
"Only admins can update users"
"User not found"
"Email is already in use"
"Invalid role. Must be 'admin' or 'customer'"
```

---

#### 2. Delete User Endpoint

```java
@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<?> deleteUser(Authentication authentication, @PathVariable Long id)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin authentication required
- ✅ Deletes user from database
- ✅ **Prevents self-deletion** (admin can't delete themselves)
- ✅ Validates user exists

**Security Checks:**
1. User must be authenticated
2. Authenticated user must be admin
3. **Cannot delete own account**
4. User to delete must exist

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User deleted successfully"
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
"Only admins can delete users"
"You cannot delete your own account"
"User not found"
```

---

## Frontend Integration

### Already Implemented:
The frontend `UserManagement.js` component already has the UI and API calls:

**Update User:**
```javascript
await usersAPI.updateUser(editingUser.id, formData);
```

**Delete User:**
```javascript
await usersAPI.deleteUser(userId);
```

**API Service** (`api.js`):
```javascript
updateUser: (id, userData) => api.put(`/users/${id}`, userData),
deleteUser: (id) => api.delete(`/users/${id}`),
```

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Change User Role

**Scenario:** Admin wants to promote a customer to admin

**Steps:**
1. Admin logs in
2. Goes to User Management page
3. Clicks "Edit" on customer user
4. Changes role from "Customer" to "Admin"
5. Clicks "Save"

**Backend Process:**
1. Validates admin authentication
2. Finds user by ID
3. Updates role field to "admin"
4. Saves to database
5. Returns updated user

---

### Use Case 2: Deactivate User

**Scenario:** Admin wants to suspend a user account

**Steps:**
1. Admin logs in
2. Goes to User Management page
3. Clicks "Edit" on user
4. Unchecks "Active" checkbox
5. Clicks "Save"

**Backend Process:**
1. Validates admin authentication
2. Finds user by ID
3. Sets `isActive` to `false`
4. Saves to database
5. Returns updated user

**Effect:**
- User cannot log in (checked in `AuthController.login`)
- Gets message: "Account is deactivated. Please contact support."

---

### Use Case 3: Delete User

**Scenario:** Admin wants to remove a spam account

**Steps:**
1. Admin logs in
2. Goes to User Management page
3. Clicks "Delete" on user
4. Confirms deletion

**Backend Process:**
1. Validates admin authentication
2. **Checks not deleting self**
3. Finds user by ID
4. Deletes from database
5. Returns success message

**Safety:** Admin cannot delete their own account

---

## Security Features

### 1. **Admin-Only Access**
```java
if (!"admin".equalsIgnoreCase(authenticatedUser.getRole())) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(403).body("Only admins can update users");
}
```

### 2. **Self-Deletion Prevention**
```java
if (authenticatedUserId.equals(id)) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(400).body("You cannot delete your own account");
}
```

### 3. **Role Validation**
```java
if (newRole.equals("admin") || newRole.equals("customer")) {
    user.setRole(newRole);
} else {
    return ResponseEntity.status(400).body("Invalid role...");
}
```

### 4. **Email Uniqueness**
```java
Optional<User> existingUser = userRepository.findByEmail(updatedUser.getEmail());
if (existingUser.isPresent() && !existingUser.get().getId().equals(id)) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(400).body("Email is already in use");
}
```

### 5. **Password Protection**
```java
savedUser.setPassword(null); // Don't send password back
```
