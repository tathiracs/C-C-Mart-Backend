# Cart Authentication & Currency Update

## Summary
Updated the shopping cart to require login before adding items and changed all prices to display in LKR (Sri Lankan Rupees) instead of USD.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Cart Authentication - Login Required

#### File: `frontend/src/contexts/CartContext.js`

**Change:** Modified `addToCart` function to check authentication status before allowing items to be added.

**New Features:**
- ✅ Checks if user is logged in before adding to cart
- ✅ Shows warning toast if user is not authenticated
- ✅ Automatically redirects to login page with return URL
- ✅ After login, user is redirected back to the product page

**Code Logic:**
```javascript
const addToCart = (product, quantity = 1) => {
  // Check if user is logged in
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    toast.warning('Please log in to add items to your cart');
    navigate('/login', { state: { from: window.location.pathname } });
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of cart logic
};
```

**User Experience:**
1. Guest user tries to add product to cart
2. Warning toast appears: "Please log in to add items to your cart"
3. User is redirected to login page
4. After successful login, user returns to the same product page
5. User can now add items to cart

## Technical Details

### Cart Context - Authentication Check

**Dependencies:**
- `useAuth` hook for authentication status
- `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation
- `react-toastify` for notifications

**Logic Flow:**
```javascript
addToCart(product, quantity) {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    toast.warning('Please log in to add items to your cart');
    navigate('/login', { state: { from: currentPath } });
    return;
  }
  
  // Add item to cart
  const existingItem = items.find(item => item.id === product.id);
  
  if (existingItem) {
    updateQuantity(product.id, existingItem.quantity + quantity);
  } else {
    setItems([...items, { ...product, quantity }]);
  }
  
  toast.success('Item added to cart!');
}
```

### Currency Format

**Standard Display:**
```javascript
// Simple display
`Rs. ${price}`

// Formatted display (if needed)
`Rs. ${price.toLocaleString('en-LK', { 
  minimumFractionDigits: 2,
  maximumFractionDigits: 2 
})}`
```

**Example Outputs:**
- `Rs. 150.00` - Single product
- `Rs. 1,250.00` - Cart total
- `Rs. 45,000.00` - Dashboard revenue
