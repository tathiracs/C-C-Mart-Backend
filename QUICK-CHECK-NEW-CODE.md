# Quick Test - Check if New Code is Loaded

Open browser console (F12) and look for this message:

**If you see:**
```
🔄 [UPDATED CODE v3.0] Admin fetching ALL orders from all users...
🔍 Making request to: /api/orders/all
```
✅ New code is loaded - backend might have an issue

**If you see:**
```
🔄 [UPDATED CODE v2.0] Admin fetching all orders...
🔍 Making request to: /api/orders
```
❌ Old code still cached - need hard refresh

**If you see no messages at all:**
❌ Very old code - need to clear cache completely

---

## Solution:

1. **Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`** (hard refresh)
2. **Or** Press `Ctrl + F5`
3. **Or** Close browser and reopen
4. **Or** Clear cache: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`

Then check console again!
