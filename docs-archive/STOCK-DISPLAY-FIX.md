# Stock Display Fix - Documentation

## Issue
Products were showing as "Out of Stock" even after increasing the quantity in the Admin Dashboard.

## Root Cause
The `ProductDetails.js` component was checking for `product.stock` instead of the correct field name `product.stockQuantity` that the backend uses.

Since `product.stock` was undefined, all stock checks were evaluating as falsy (0 or undefined), causing products to always show as "Out of Stock".

## Backend Field Name
```java
// Product.java
private Integer stockQuantity = 0;
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. ProductDetails.js
Changed all occurrences of `product.stock` to `product.stockQuantity`:

**Changes made:**
- `handleAddToCart()` function: `product.stock <= 0` → `product.stockQuantity <= 0`
- Stock status display: `product.stock > 0` → `product.stockQuantity > 0`
- Stock count display: `{product.stock} available` → `{product.stockQuantity} available`
- Add to Cart button: `product.stock <= 0` → `product.stockQuantity <= 0`
- Button text: `product.stock > 0` → `product.stockQuantity > 0`

## Already Correct Files
- ✅ `Products.js` - Already using `product.stockQuantity`
- ✅ `Home.js` - Already using `product.stockQuantity`

## Testing
1. Navigate to Products page (`/products`)
2. Products should now show correct stock status
3. Click "View Details" on any product
4. Stock status should display correctly:
   - ✅ Green check with "In Stock (X available)" if stockQuantity > 0
   - ❌ Red X with "Out of Stock" if stockQuantity = 0
5. "Add to Cart" button should be:
   - Enabled when stockQuantity > 0
   - Disabled when stockQuantity = 0

## Impact
✅ Products listing page - Working correctly (was already correct)
✅ Product details page - Now fixed
✅ Home page featured products - Working correctly (was already correct)
✅ Admin dashboard - No changes needed
