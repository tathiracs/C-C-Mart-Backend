## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Category Dropdown Empty in Admin
**Problem:** Category dropdown in ProductManagement.js showed no options  
**Cause:** Code was checking `response.data.data` but backend returns array directly in `response.data`  
**Solution:** Updated to properly handle backend response structure  
**Status:** FIXED

### 2. ✅ "undefined kg" in Stock Column
**Problem:** Stock column showing "undefined kg" instead of actual quantity  
**Cause:** Using snake_case field names (`stock_quantity`, `category_id`) instead of camelCase (`stockQuantity`, `categoryId`)  
**Solution:** Updated all field names in ProductManagement.js to match backend JSON serialization  
**Status:** FIXED

### 3. ✅ Products Always Showing "Out of Stock"
**Problem:** ProductDetails page showed all products as out of stock even when they had quantity  
**Cause:** Using `product.stock` instead of `product.stockQuantity`  
**Solution:** Updated ProductDetails.js to use correct field name  
**Status:** FIXED

### 4. ✅ Footer Showing in Admin Dashboard
**Problem:** Footer appearing in admin pages  
**Cause:** Admin routes were nested inside Layout component which includes footer  
**Solution:** Moved admin routes outside Layout in App.js  
**Status:** FIXED

## 📊 Current Known Issue

### Product ID Not Found Error
**Observation:** Accessing `/products/81` shows "Failed to load product details"  
**Cause:** Product with ID 81 doesn't exist in the database  
**Solution:** This is expected behavior when trying to access a non-existent product

**To resolve:**
1. Navigate to `/products` to see existing products
2. Click "View Details" on any existing product
3. OR add products through Admin Dashboard (`/admin/products`)
4. Product IDs start from 1 and increment with each new product

**Note:** The error handling is working correctly - it shows a proper error message and "Back to Products" button.
