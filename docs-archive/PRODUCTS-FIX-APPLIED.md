# Fix for Products Not Showing

## Problem Identified ✅
Products created through the Admin Dashboard were not being set as `isActive = true` explicitly in the ProductController's `create` method. The frontend filters out products where `isActive === false`, so these products weren't visible on the Products page.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Code (ProductController.java)
**Create Method:**
- Added: `p.setIsActive(true);` to explicitly set new products as active

**Update Method:**
- Fixed the logic to properly handle isActive updates
- Added category update support

## Fix Existing Products in Database

Run this SQL command to fix your existing products:

```sql
-- Connect to your MySQL database
USE ccmart_db;

-- Check current status of products
SELECT id, name, is_active FROM products;

-- Update all existing products to be active
UPDATE products SET is_active = true WHERE is_active IS NULL OR is_active = false;

-- Verify the fix
SELECT id, name, is_active FROM products;
```

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend
The code changes have been made. Now restart your backend:

1. Stop the backend server (Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
2. Restart it:
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Fix Existing Products in Database

**Option A: Using MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin**
1. Open MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin
2. Connect to database `ccmart_db`
3. Run this SQL:
```sql
UPDATE products SET is_active = 1 WHERE is_active IS NULL OR is_active = 0;
```

**Option B: Using Command Line**
```bash
mysql -u root -p
# Enter password: Root123@
USE ccmart_db;
UPDATE products SET is_active = 1;
SELECT * FROM products;
exit;
```

**Option C: Quick Fix via Admin Dashboard**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Products
2. Click Edit on each product (Fresh Carrots, Tomatoes, etc.)
3. Just click Save (this will trigger the update and set isActive properly)

### Step 3: Refresh Products Page
After fixing the database:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/products
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. All products should now be visible!

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:
- Fresh Carrots
- Fresh Tomatoes
- Green Beans
- Red Onions
- Bell Peppers
- milk

All 6 products should be visible on the Products page.

## Future Prevention

All new products created after this fix will automatically be set as `isActive = true`, so this issue won't happen again!

## Console Check

Open browser console (F12) and you should now see:
```
Product count: 6
Active products: 6
```

Instead of:
```
Product count: 6  
Active products: 1
```
