# FINAL FIX - Activate All 80 Products

## Current Status
- **Total Products**: 81
- **Active**: 1 (milk)
- **Inactive**: 80 (all others)

## What I Did
1. âœ… Added `isActive` field to ProductDTO
2. âœ… Fixed ProductController to set `isActive=true` for new products
3. âœ… Fixed update method to activate products on edit
4. âœ… Added `/api/products/fix-active` endpoint to batch activate all products

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Restart Backend (REQUIRED)
The backend needs to restart to load the new endpoint:

1. Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
2. Restart it:
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script
Once backend is restarted:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\imax.computer\OneDrive\Desktop\OOAD Project - Copy\Chamika\C-C_Mart"
.\quick-fix-products.ps1
```

This will:
- Login as admin (admin@ccmart.com / Admin@123)
- Call the `/fix-active` endpoint
- Activate all 80 inactive products

### Step 3: Verify
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/products
2. Refresh (F5)
3. You should see all 81 products!

## Alternative: Manual SQL (If script doesn't work)

If you have access to MySQL:

```sql
USE ccmart_db;
UPDATE products SET is_active = 1;
```

## Why This Happened

The Product model has `isActive = true` as default in Java, but when products are created via the controller, the value wasn't being explicitly set. The database column defaulted to NULL or false, and the frontend filters out products where `isActive !== false`.

## Prevention

All future products will automatically be active because the controller now explicitly sets:
```java
p.setIsActive(true);
```

## Summary

**After backend restart + running the script:**
- âœ… All 81 products will be visible
- âœ… Cart will work properly  
- âœ… All images will show (with fallback placeholders)
- âœ… Future products will be active by default

Just restart the backend and run the script! ðŸš€
