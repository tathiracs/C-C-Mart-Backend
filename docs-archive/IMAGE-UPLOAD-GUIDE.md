## Verifying Products Are Saved:

### Check Your Database:
Your products ARE being saved to the database. The error you see is because you're accessing the wrong product ID.

### To See Your Products:
1. **Option A - Admin Dashboard:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/products`
   - You'll see all products in the table
   - Note the product IDs in the table

2. **Option B - Products Page:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/products`
   - All saved products display here
   - Click "View Details" on any product card

3. **Option C - Check Backend:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Run: 
     ```javascript
     fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/products')
       .then(r => r.json())
       .then(products => {
         console.log('Total products:', products.length);
         console.table(products.map(p => ({
           id: p.id,
           name: p.name,
           price: p.price,
           stock: p.stockQuantity
         })));
       });
     ```

## Why You Saw "Failed to load product details":

The URL showed `/products/81` but:
- Product ID 81 doesn't exist in your database
- Products start at ID 1 and increment (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- If you added 5 products, IDs would be 1-5, not 81

### Solution:
Instead of typing `/products/81`, do this:
1. Go to `/products` (products listing page)
2. See all your products displayed
3. Click "View Details" button on any product
4. It will navigate to the correct ID (e.g., `/products/3`)

### What Happens When You Upload:
1. File is selected from your computer
2. JavaScript reads the file as Base64 data
