# Image Not Showing - Fix Guide

## Problem
Product images are not displaying on the Products page because the products don't have valid image URLs in the database.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Add Image URL When Creating Product (Recommended)
When adding a product through Admin Dashboard:

1. Go to **Admin Dashboard** → **Products**
2. Click **Add New Product**
3. Fill in all product details
4. In the **Image URL** field, paste a valid image URL like:
   - `https://example.com/milk.jpg`
   - Or use free image hosting services like:
     - Imgur: https://imgur.com
     - ImgBB: https://imgbb.com
     - Direct links from product websites

**Example URLs you can test with:**
- Milk: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550583724-b2692b85b150?w=300`
- Apple: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568702846914-96b305d2aaeb?w=300`
- Bread: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509440159596-0249088772ff?w=300`

### Option 2: Upload Image File
When adding a product:
1. Click the **Upload Image** button
2. Select an image file from your computer
3. The image will be converted to base64 and stored
4. Preview will show immediately

### Option 3: Update Existing Products
To fix the "milk" product that's not showing an image:

1. Go to **Admin Dashboard** → **Products**
2. Find the "milk" product
3. Click **Edit**
4. Add a valid image URL or upload an image file
5. Click **Save**

## What Changed in the Code

### Added Error Handling
All image components now have:
- `onError` handler that shows placeholder if image fails to load
- Better placeholder images using placehold.co
- Validation to check if imageUrl is empty or null

### Improved Image Display
- Changed from `objectFit: 'cover'` to `'contain'` - shows full image
- Added light gray background
- Added padding around images
- Increased image sizes for better visibility

### Files Updated
1. `Products.js` - Product listing page
2. `Home.js` - Featured products
3. `Cart.js` - Cart items
4. `ProductDetails.js` - Product detail page

## Testing

### Check Browser Console
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab. You should see:
```
Loaded products: [...]
Product: milk, Image: null
```

This tells you if the image URL is null or invalid.

### Verify in Database
The product should have a valid `image_url` column value in the `products` table.

## Quick Fix for Testing

If you want to quickly test with a valid image, use this SQL to update your milk product:

```sql
UPDATE products 
SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550583724-b2692b85b150?w=300' 
WHERE name = 'milk';
```

Or use the Admin Dashboard to edit the product and add an image URL.

## Current Placeholder
If no image is provided, the system shows a gray placeholder with "No Image" text.
This is expected behavior and shows the image handling is working correctly.
