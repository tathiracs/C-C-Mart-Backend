public class Product {

    private String name;                  // Product name
    private String description;           // Product description
    private BigDecimal price;             // Product price
    private Category category;            // ManyToOne relationship
    private String imageUrl;              // Product image URL
    private Integer stockQuantity;        // Stock quantity (default: 0)
    private String unit;                  // Unit (default: "piece")

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Category Dropdown Fix
**Issue:** Empty category dropdown in Admin Products page  
**Root Cause:** Code was checking `response.data.data` but backend returns array in `response.data`  
**Solution:** Updated to handle both response structures with proper array checking

### 2. Stock Display Fix
**Issue:** "undefined kg" showing in Admin Products page  
**Root Cause:** Using snake_case (`stock_quantity`) instead of camelCase (`stockQuantity`)  
**Solution:** Updated all field names to match backend JSON serialization (camelCase)

### 3. Product Details Out of Stock
**Issue:** All products showing as "Out of Stock" even with quantity  
**Root Cause:** ProductDetails.js using `product.stock` instead of `product.stockQuantity`  
**Solution:** Updated all stock references to use `stockQuantity`

### 4. Admin Footer Removal
**Issue:** Footer showing in admin dashboard  
**Root Cause:** Admin routes nested inside Layout component  
**Solution:** Moved admin routes outside Layout in App.js routing structure
