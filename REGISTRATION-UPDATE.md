# Registration Flow Update - Manual Login Required

## Summary
Updated the registration flow to require users to manually log in after creating an account, instead of being automatically logged in.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### File: `backend/src/main/java/com/ccmart/backend/controller/AuthController.java`

**Change:** Modified the `/register` endpoint to not generate a JWT token during registration.

**Before:**
- Generated JWT token immediately after user registration
- Returned token along with user details
- User was automatically authenticated

**After:**
- Only creates the user account
- Returns success message without token
- User must manually log in to get authenticated

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful! Please log in with your credentials.",
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "customer"
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### File: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`

**Change:** Modified the `register` function to not dispatch `LOGIN_SUCCESS` action.

**Before:**
- Dispatched `LOGIN_SUCCESS` after successful registration
- Stored token in localStorage
- User was automatically logged in

**After:**
- Only sets loading state to false
- Shows success message via toast
- User remains unauthenticated

---

#### File: `frontend/src/pages/Auth/Register.js`

**Change:** Updated the redirect behavior after successful registration.

**Before:**
- Redirected to home page (`/`)
- User was already logged in

**After:**
- Redirects to login page (`/login`)
- Passes success message and email via route state
- User needs to manually enter credentials

**Redirect Data:**
```javascript
navigate('/login', { 
  state: { 
    message: 'Registration successful! Please log in with your credentials.',
    email: data.email 
  } 
});
```

---

#### File: `frontend/src/pages/Auth/Login.js`

**Changes:** 
1. Added support for displaying registration success message
2. Auto-fills email field if redirected from registration

**New Features:**
- Displays green success alert when redirected from registration
- Pre-populates email field with registered email
- User only needs to enter password

**Default Form Values:**
```javascript
defaultValues: {
  email: registrationEmail || '',
  password: '',
}
```

---

## User Experience Flow

### New Registration Flow:

1. **User visits Register page** (`/register`)
   - Fills in: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password

2. **User submits registration form**
   - Backend creates account
   - Backend returns success message (no token)
   - Frontend shows toast: "Registration successful! Please log in."

3. **User automatically redirected to Login page** (`/login`)
   - Green success alert displayed: "Registration successful! Please log in with your credentials."
   - Email field pre-filled with registered email
   - User only needs to enter password

4. **User logs in**
   - Backend validates credentials
   - Backend generates JWT token
   - Frontend stores token and user data
   - User is redirected to home page (customers) or admin dashboard (admins)

## Benefits of This Approach

### Security
- ✅ Separates registration and authentication concerns
- ✅ Ensures password validation on first login
- ✅ Prevents potential token theft during registration process

### User Experience
- ✅ Clear separation between account creation and login
- ✅ Email auto-filled on login page (convenience)
- ✅ Success message confirms account creation
- ✅ User explicitly authenticates with their new credentials

### Best Practices
- ✅ Follows standard registration flows (similar to Gmail, Amazon, etc.)
- ✅ Gives users control over their authentication
- ✅ Allows for email verification step in future (if needed)
